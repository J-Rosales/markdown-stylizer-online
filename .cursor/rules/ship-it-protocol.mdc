# Git workflow trigger words

Use these exact phrases (uppercase) to authorize git operations:

- `SHIP IT`: Create a new branch (kebab case name chosen by the agent), stage all
  changes, commit, push, open a PR to `main`, then ask for confirmation before
  merging.
- `SHIP IT NOW`: Same as above, but merge into `main` immediately after the PR is
  created.

If the trigger phrase is not present, do not push, create PRs, or merge.
