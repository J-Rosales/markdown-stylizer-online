# Git workflow trigger words

Use these exact phrases (uppercase) to authorize git operations:

- `SHIP IT`: Create a new branch (kebab case name chosen by the agent), stage all
  changes, commit, and **print** the exact `git push`, `gh pr create`, and merge
  commands for the user to run locally. Ask for confirmation before merge.
- `SHIP IT NOW`: Same as above, but **print** the commands and instruct the user
  to merge immediately after PR creation (no extra confirmation from the agent).

If the trigger phrase is not present, do not push, create PRs, or merge.
